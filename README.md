# Telecom Knowledge Assistant (RAG + Endee)

## Overview

This project is a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** based Telecom Knowledge Assistant.
It answers telecom and networking-related questions using **semantic search** over
domain-specific documents instead of generic internet data.

The system demonstrates how **vector databases like Endee** can be used in AI applications
for efficient information retrieval.

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional keyword-based search systems fail to understand the meaning of user queries.
This project solves the problem by:

- Converting telecom documents into vector embeddings
- Performing semantic similarity search
- Generating context-aware answers from retrieved content

---

## System Architecture

1. Telecom documents are stored as text files
2. Documents are converted into embeddings using Sentence Transformers
3. Embeddings are stored in an **Endee-compatible vector format**
4. User queries are embedded and matched using cosine similarity
5. Relevant context is retrieved
6. A local generation layer produces a focused answer
7. Results are displayed using a Streamlit web interface

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Sentence Transformers
- Endee (Vector Database – conceptual integration)
- NumPy
- Streamlit
- Git & GitHub

## How Endee Is Used

Endee is used as the vector database layer in the system design.
The Endee repository was forked and reviewed to align the vector storage design with Endee’s indexing architecture.
Embeddings are stored in an Endee-compatible vector format to support semantic search and RAG workflows.
